        "Jan buckled on her diving belt of metal weights and dropped from the launch. Skipper Kells supervised her air-hose to prevent tangling. Leo, following the bubbles, guided the dinghy above the diver, as she searched the mysterious underwater world. Jan surfaced frequently clutching crayfish. The required number of specimens was almost obtained when the grey nurse shark advanced directly towards her. Jan retreated cautiously without signalling for assistance. The creature brushed by, ignoring her, as baby sharks emerged from some rocky grooves. Their welfare was more important to the shark than the diver’s now motionless figure. ",

      comprehension:
        "Among animals, the fox has no rival for cunning. Suspicious of man, who is its only natural enemy, it will, when pursued, perform extraordinary feats, even alighting on the backs of sheep to divert its scent. Parent foxes share the responsibilities of cub-rearing. Through their hunting expeditions, they acquire an uncanny knowledge of their surroundings which they use in an emergency. This is well illustrated by the story of a hunted fox which led its pursuers to a neglected mine-shaft enclosed by a circular hedge. It appeared to surmount the barrier. The hounds followed headlong, only to fall into the accumulated water below. The fox, however, apparently on familiar territory, had skirted the hedge and subsequently escaped",
